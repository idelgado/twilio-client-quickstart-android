## Deprecation Notice

**The Twilio Client SDKs for Android & iOS have been deprecated and superseded by the [Programmable Voice SDKs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/voip-sdk)**. The Programmable Voice SDK offers many improvements over the Twilio Client SDK, including greater stability, improved backgrounding, and built-in support for push notifications for incoming calls.

Get started with the Programmable Voice SDK by using one of the quickstart's below:

* [Android Quickstart](https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-android)
* [Objective-C Quickstart](https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-objc)
* [Swift Quickstart](https://github.com/twilio/voice-quickstart-swift)

If you're just getting started with a mobile application for voice calling, we recommend you use the Programmable Voice SDKs. If you're already using the Twilio Client SDK, you should plan to upgrade to the Programmable Voice SDK as soon as possible. There is no active development on the deprecated Twilio Client SDKs for mobile. If you encounter a problem that requires a change you will be asked to upgrade to the Programmable Voice SDK.
